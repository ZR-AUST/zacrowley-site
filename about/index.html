        <h2>Background</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            I’ve spent my career working inside complex systems and learning how decisions actually get made.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started working early, first as a personal trainer and then in the Security Division for a NSW Government entity while completing my undergraduate degree. Alongside that, I built a sports technology startup, which pushed me into the realities of product, customers, and execution early.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, my work moved deeper into strategy and problem-solving. I studied further, worked as a consultant in medical and technology-adjacent environments, and was later headhunted by Apple to work on confidential special projects across APAC research and development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began angel investing, advised early-stage startups, and spent time in San Francisco in a venture fund environment. I later completed an MBA and worked at BCG Digital Ventures, where clarity, speed to output, and execution mattered more than presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, my work has spanned advisory, consulting, and fractional roles with startups and growing businesses. The common thread has never been titles or optics. It has been ownership, judgment, and follow-through.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m often described as a workhorse rather than a show pony. That’s accurate.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            I’m most effective in ambiguity. I’m drawn to problems that are poorly defined, numerically complex, or sitting between functions where ownership is unclear.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m outcomes-driven. I value clarity, speed to decision, and accountability. I have low tolerance for environments where responsibility is avoided or work is siloed behind job descriptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also value kindness and empathy. The best work happens when people feel respected and supported, even in high-pressure situations.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>A note on how I’m wired</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            I was formally diagnosed with ADHD in 2022. For me, this shows up as deep curiosity, pattern recognition, and an ability to hold complex systems in my head for long periods of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s part of why I gravitate toward numbers-driven work, complex financial models, and problem-solving that spans strategy and execution. It does not define me, but it does explain how I approach problems.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Outside of work</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Outside of work, I care about learning, building, and health. I spend time strength training, practicing breathwork, and training jiu jitsu. I also surf and play golf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Family matters deeply to me. I keep that part of my life mostly private, but it informs how I think about responsibility and the impact of the work I choose to do.
          </p>

            This page is not a résumé, a consulting pitch, or a complete history. Those details live elsewhere. This page exists to give context to how I think and how I work.
